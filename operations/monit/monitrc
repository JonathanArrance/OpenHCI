# By default Monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available. 
# To keep the alerts for later delivery retry, we set EVENTQUEUE statement.
# The base directory where undelivered alerts will be stored is specified
# by the BASEDIR option. We limit the maximal queue size using the SLOTS
# option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space available).
