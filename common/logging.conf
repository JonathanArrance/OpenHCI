# logging.conf
#
#  This configuration file is used to define how logging is performed by the TransCirrus logging utility.

# Defaults section
#  These are the default values used in this config file. Normally these are the only parameters that would be changed.
#
#    Level: The default logging level. The order of logging from lowest to highest is: NotSet, Debug, Warning, Error, Critical
#    Logfile: The path and filename for the logged output. Currently the Sys & Sql messages are logged to the same file.
#    Logfile Size: The size (in bytes) at which time a new log file is created.
#    Logfile Backup Count: The number of old copies of the log file to keep. If the backup count is 4 and the logfile size is 5MB
#                          then the max amount of disk space consumed by the log files would be (1 + 4) * 5MB = 25MB
#
#  If in the future the Sys log file is seperated from Sql log file, some additional defaults will need to be created to split out
#  out Sys, Sql and Raw (which is common to both Sys & Sql)
#
